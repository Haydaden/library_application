Hello! This is a RESTful API using SpringBoot, backed by PostgreSQL and Docker, to manage a personal library amassed through college and beyond. My intention is to enable efficient tracking of read and unread texts as well as categorization by genre. I wanted to have an avenue for re-learning historical context for certain texts, so I'm currently expanding the system with technologies like Kafka to enable asynchronous metadata enrichment, incorporating historical background, author information, and thematic summaries, to deepen personal understanding of each text.

So far, this is a project dedicated to work primarily on the backend, but I will be integrating frontend capabilities with React after adding additional functionality. Thanks for checking it out!
